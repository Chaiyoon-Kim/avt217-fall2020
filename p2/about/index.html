It is located on the Han River at the junction of inland waterways and the sea, which means it is perfect for the transport of goods in trade. The location of Seoul is also excellent according to geomancy, which is the art of arranging buildings favorably. The city is based within a topographic basin surrounded by low hills. The growth of the city was not considerable until the early 20th century and the city remained roughly the same physical size for hundreds of years.
