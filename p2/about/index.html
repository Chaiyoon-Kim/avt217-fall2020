      <div class="history">
        <p>Seoul has been the capital of Korea since 1394 and the capital of South Korea since 1948. The word Seoul means capital in the Korean language. Seoul became the capital city in 1394 because of its strategic advantages from a defense point of view. It is located on the Han River at the junction of inland waterways and the sea, which means it is perfect for the transport of goods in trade. The location of Seoul is also excellent according to geomancy, which is the art of arranging buildings favorably. The city is based within a topographic basin surrounded by low hills. The growth of the city was not considerable until the early 20th century and the city remained roughly the same physical size for hundreds of years. </p>
        <p>In 1876 Korea became exposed to the western influence at a time when the Choson dynasty was weak and could not control the influence. in 1905 a Japanese protectorate was established over the kingdom. The Japanese started and introducing modernization to Seoul that lead to constant growth and expansion of the capital city over half a century, they introduced modern technology and paved roads and western style construction. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen explosive population and physical growth in Seoul making it one of the biggest cities in the world.</P>

        <h3>When to Go to South Korea</h3>
        </div>
    </div>

        <p>South Korea experiences four unique seasons: a dry, cold winter running from November through March, a verdant spring lasting from March through late May, a muggy and rainy monsoon season that extends through the duration of the summer months, and a crisp autumn that runs from September through November. The spring and autumn are the best seasons for South Korea travel, although winter sports enthusiasts should consider visiting the country during its winter months, when its myriad
        of resorts and fine powder make it an ideal winter getaway. The heat and crowds of summer make it the worst season for travel to South Korea.</p>
